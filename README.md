### Project Description.
  The goal of this project was to analyze 311 calls in the City of Austin over a three-year period from 2014 â€“ 2017 and to determine what are the major concerns of citizens of Austin, how do the number of 311 calls differ over 3 years and within each year, what Austin zip codes have the most / least 311 calls and is there in any correlation of 311 calls with other socioeconomic factors and crime by addressing and answering the following questions.

### Questions 1: What are the major concerns of citizens of Austin and their community? 
  All 311 calls are handled by different departments with the City of Austin government. As shown in the figure below, we analyzed which departments handled the most complaints. 
  We found that the majority of the 311 complaints from 2014-2016 where handled by Animal Services, Austin Code, Transportation, Austin Resource Recovery departments and Public Works.

  Since Austin is considered a pet friendly city it is not surprising to see that the majority of complaints were handled by Animal Services. When we looked at the complaint description for all the complaints handled by Animal Services, we found that loose dogs, assistance from Animal Control, injured/sick made up the majority of these complaints as shown in the figure below.

### Questions 2: How do the number of 311 calls differ over 3 years and are there any differences in the number of 311 calls within each year?




### Questions 3: What is the distribution of 311 calls by zip code?



### Questions 4: Is there any correlation between the number 311 calls and income, population or the number of crimes by zip code?



### Question 5: How do four different neighborhoods in Austin that vary in household income differ in the types of 311 complaints?

### Project Description.

  The goal of this project was to analyze 311 calls in the City of Austin over a three-year period from 2014 â€“ 2017 and to determine what are the major concerns of citizens of Austin, how do the number of 311 calls differ over 3 years and within each year, what Austin zip codes have the most / least 311 calls and is there in any correlation of 311 calls with other socioeconomic factors and crime by addressing and answering the following questions.

### Question 1: How do the number of 311 calls differ yearly and within each year?

  We were fortunated to have such a large data set for 311 calls. We found that the intial .csv file had data from December 2013 - August 2017. Since 2013 and 2017 were incomplete, we decided to focus only on the years 2014 - 2016. 
  
  When we analyzed the number of 311 complaints over these three years, we found that the majority of the calls/complaints occured between April and October. As shown in the figure below, the number of 311 complaints from January - April, and October - December for all three years were equvialent. Interestingly, the number of 311 complaints between May - July of 2015 were greater than the 311 complaints from the same months in 2014 and 2016. Moreover, July of 2016 had the fewer 311 complaints compared to July of 2014.

  ### Question 2: What are the major concerns of citizens of Austin and their community? 
  
  All 311 calls are handled by different departments with the City of Austin government. As shown in the figure below, we analyzed which departments handled the most complaints. 
  We found that the majority of the 311 complaints from 2014-2016 where handled by Animal Services, Austin Code, Transportation, Austin Resource Recovery departments and Public Works.

  Since Austin is considered a pet friendly city it is not surprising to see that the majority of complaints were handled by Animal Services. When we looked at the complaint description for all the complaints handled by Animal Services, we found that loose dogs, assistance from Animal Control, injured/sick made up the majority of these complaints as shown in the figure below.

### Question 3: What is the distribution of 311 complaints in each zip code in Austin?
  
  Breaking down the distribution of the number of 311 complaints by zip code, we found that the 78745 and 78704 zip codes had the most 311 complaints followed closely by 78702.

### Question 4: Is there any correlation between the number 311 calls and income, population or the number of crimes by zip code?



### Question 5: How do four different neighborhoods in Austin that vary in household income differ in the types of 311 complaints?

  Goal was to identify four zip codes with varying household incomes
